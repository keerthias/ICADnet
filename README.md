# ICADnet
ICADnet is  a prior knowledge-based framework for aneurysm detection from TOF-MRA volume.  It embeds task-specific domain knowledge as a function or operator into the deep learning model to develop a framework for aneurysm detection with limited training samples and, thereby, improve the generalization and  efficiency of the CAD systems.
